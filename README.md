This project consists of two parts: Neural Networks and Sentiment Analysis.

## Part 1: Neural Networks

To estimate the income of our clients, we employed a dataset of bank records. This required preparing the data, putting a neural network and a linear regression model into practice, and comparing how well they performed. We also forecasted for new clients that weren't in the initial dataset.

## Part 2: Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis of tweets about the Omicron variant was done. The VADER SentimentIntensityAnalyzer was used to clean and analyse the tweets. Using bar and pie charts, we were able to visualise the general sentiment (positive, neutral, and negative).
